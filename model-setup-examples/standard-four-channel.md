## Standard Four Channel

In a standard four channel setup, the simplest way to set up your model is to use the model wizard.

If you cancel the model wizard, the default setup is to provide four channels configured appropriate to your radio settings.

You will notice on the mixer screen that there is an capital letter I next to each of the names.   This refers to the corresponding item on the input screen.

To find out more about what can go on these screens, review [Inputs](/inputs.md) and [Mixer](/mixer.md) sections.
