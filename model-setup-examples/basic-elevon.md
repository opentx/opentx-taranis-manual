## Basic Elevon

Elevons are control surfaces that combine the functions of the elevator and the aileron.

You usually see this sort of configuration on tailless aircraft.

A good example of this is an aircraft known asa "flying wing".

Here is what basic eleven set up might look like on your radio, we are using the default AETR output.

In this example, the exponential on the Aileron and Elevator inputs are set to 60%.   This is not a required setting.

Additionally, the negatives values were required for this particular plane, you may not need to use the negative values for the Ailerons as shown here.

For the Elevator setting, you will need to have them be opposite as shown here.
