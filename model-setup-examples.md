# Model Setup Examples

We have put together some simple examples of how to set up the radio, depending on your needs.

Some of the features we cover are:

* Mixers
* Special functions
* Logic Switches
* Flight modes

OpenTx allows all sorts of interesting ways to program your transmitter.

Hopefully these examples will get you started in the right direction.

All examples are assuming a Taranis X9D+ and using the internal FrSky module in Mode 2.

Because of this, the channel order in the examples with be AETR

* Channel1 = **A**ileron
* Channel2 = **E**levator
* Channel3 = **T**hrottle
* Channel4 = **R**udder

If you are using an external module or a different transmitter mode, your channel order may need to be different.

Where appropriate, we refer back to the manual to talk about the specific screens so that you may refer to them while going through this section.
