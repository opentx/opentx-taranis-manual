We have put together some simple examples of how to set up the radio, depending on your needs.

Some of the features we cover are:

* Mixers
* Special functions
* Logic Switches
* Flight modes

OpenTx allows all sorts of interesting ways to program your transmitter.

Hopefully these examples will get you started in the right direction.

All examples are assuming a Taranis 9XD+ and using the internal FrSky module in Mode 2.

Because of this, the channel order with be AETR 

* Channel1 = **A**ileron
* Channel2 = **E**levator
* Channel3 = **T**hrottle
* Channel4 = **R**udder

If you are using an external module or a different transmitter mode, your channel order may need to be different.
