Everybody knows by now that FrSky has chosen OpenTX as the operating system for their new Taranis radio :)

This manual intends to describe the OpenTX firmware installed on the Taranis.

It will offer some explanations about the philosophy of the firmware and how to set up models.

We'll start with an overview of menu contents, and then go into more details about how to set up models.

The Taranis version of OpenTX has all the features from the 9X version.

It also includes the additions of the sky9x version.

Items included are:
* Audio/speech
* SD card for model/audio files/log storage
* USB access to card and settings/model memory
* The UI adapted to the larger screen
* Different button layout
* Adds support for the Taranis' extra hardware capabilities.
